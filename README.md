# Mud Proxy Protocol

This repository aims to describe a new protocol for communication between
a proxy and a MUD server. The draft of the protocol is in `proxy-auth.md`.

The protocol was thought up by me, and a lot of input was provided by Stendec
and Vigud in the #nakedmud IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.

The draft is still in the...draft stages and will be updated as I receive
feedback.

I will also be adding tools that can be used for various purposes, including
verifying that your MUD server implements the protocol correctly.
